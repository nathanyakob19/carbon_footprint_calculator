# Carbon Emission Calculator

This is a simple web-based Carbon Emission Calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The tool estimates carbon emissions based on user inputs like electricity usage, gas consumption, fuel used by cars, and mileage.

## 🌍 Purpose

The aim of this project is to help users become more aware of their carbon footprint by estimating their emissions using daily activities. It provides a quick and user-friendly way to calculate estimated CO2 emissions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- User input for:
  - Monthly electricity bill (in kWh)
  - Gas used (in liters)
  - Car fuel consumption (in liters)
  - Car mileage (in kilometers)
- Calculates estimated carbon emissions in `kgCO2e/mile`
- Clean and responsive UI
- Inline JavaScript for instant results

---

## 🧮 Formula Used

```

carbonEmission =
(electricityBill \* 105) +
(gasUsed \* 105) +
(carFuelConsumption \* 0.79) +
(carMileage \* 113)

```

> Units are approximations for demonstration purposes and may not reflect real-world carbon data accurately.
